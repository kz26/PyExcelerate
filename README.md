## Installation

    pip install pyexcelerate

## Usage

### Writing bulk data

```python
from pyexcelerate import Workbook

data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] # data is a 2D array

wb = Workbook()
wb.new_sheet("sheet name", data=data)
wb.save("output.xlsx")

```

### Writing bulk data to a range

PyExcelerate also permits you to write data to ranges directly, which is faster than writing cell-by-cell.

```python
from pyexcelerate import Workbook

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.new_sheet("test")
ws.range("B2", "C3").value = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
wb.save("output.xlsx")

```

### Writing cell data

```python
from datetime import datetime
from pyexcelerate import Workbook

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.new_sheet("sheet name")
ws[1][1].value = 15 # a number
ws[1][2].value = 20
ws[1][3].value = "=SUM(A1,B1)" # a formula
ws[1][4].value = datetime.now() # a date
wb.save("output.xlsx")

```

### Selecting cells by name

```python
from pyexcelerate import Workbook

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.new_sheet("sheet name")
ws.cell("A1").value = 12
wb.save("output.xlsx")

```

### Merging cells

```python
from pyexcelerate import Workbook

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.new_sheet("sheet name")
ws[1][1].value = 15
ws.range("A1", "B1").merge()
wb.save("output.xlsx")

```

## Packaging with PyInstaller, cx\_freeze, py2exe, etc.

PyExelerate has been successfully tested with PyInstaller and cx\_freeze; py2exe should work as well.
**However, you will need to manually copy the templates directory from PyExcelerate into your app's distribution.**
